## React 19 and above

From React 19, web components are fully supported. If you use custom tag names, you must configure
the TypeScript parser to recognize the custom elements. An [example TypeScript definition](https://github.com/vscode-elements/examples/blob/react-vite/react-vite/src/global.d.ts) is 
available in the examples repository. To ensure proper functionality, keep the following rules in mind:

- Props are treated as properties if they exist on the element instance; otherwise, they are assigned as attributes.
- Unlike native HTML elements, use the `class` and `for` props instead of `className` and `htmlFor`.  
- Custom events are prefixed with `on` without further modification. For example, the `vsc-split-layout-change` event becomes `onvsc-split-layout-change`.

### Example

```typescript
import "@vscode-elements/elements/dist/vscode-split-layout";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <vscode-split-layout
        initialHandlePosition="50%"
        onvsc-split-layout-change={(event) => {
          console.log(event);
        }}
      ></vscode-split-layout>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## React 18 and older

In React 18 and earlier, custom elements were not fully supported. Properties and custom events
had to be added imperatively using the useEffect hook. To simplify this process, a separate package
was created, providing wrapper components based on the [@lit/react](https://lit.dev/docs/frameworks/react/) package. To integrate these
wrapper components into your React app, install the package via npm:

```bash
npm i @vscode-elements/react-elements
```

### Using the components

Wrapper component names follow the PascalCase convention, derived from the tag names of
the corresponding web components.

```typescript
import { VscodeSplitLayout } from "@vscode-elements/react-elements";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <VscodeSplitLayout
        initialHandlePosition="50%"
        onVscSplitLayoutChange={(event) => {
          console.log(event);
        }}
      ></VscodeSplitLayout>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Install Webview Playground (Optional)

VSCode Elements components are unstyled by default. To apply the same styles used in the VSCode
webview during development, you can install the Webview Playground developer tools.

### Install the package

```bash
npm i -D @vscode-elements/webview-playground
```

### Adding to the application

The following example assumes the use of Vite as the bundler.

```typescript {1-3} {8}
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  await import("@vscode-elements/webview-playground");
}

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      {import.meta.env.DEV ? <vscode-dev-toolbar></vscode-dev-toolbar> : null}
      <div>
        Rest of the app...
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default App;
```
